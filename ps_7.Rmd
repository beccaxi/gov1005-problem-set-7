## Question 1: Conduct exploratory data analysis

### 1A) Summary Statistics

```{r 1A, echo=FALSE}

# I create a tibble from the csv data, filtering for Senators (chamber ==
# “Senate”) and Representatives (chamber == “House”) in the 116th Congress and
# filtering out all independents (party_code == 328). I then create three new
# variables: "party", which records either “Democrat” (party_code == 100) or
# “Republican” (part_code == 200) using an efficient ifelse condition; "age",
# which is 2019 (when the 116th Congress was sworn in) minus birth year; and
# "nominate_percentile", which gives the percentile rank of nominate_dim1 using
# the percent_rank() function.

sen_rep_116 <- data %>% 
  filter(
    congress == 116, 
    chamber == "Senate" | chamber == "House",
    party_code != 328
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    party = ifelse(party_code == 100, "Democrat", "Republican"),
    age = 2019 - born,
    nominate_percentile = percent_rank(nominate_dim1)
  )

# Here I print the output of calling skim on the nominate_percentile and age
# variables, as an alternative to summary

 skim(sen_rep_116$nominate_percentile)
 skim(sen_rep_116$age)
```


### 1B) Visualizing a single variable

```{r 1B, echo=FALSE}

# Make a nice plot (histogram or bar chart) showing the distribution of
# congressional ages. Feel free to be creative- maybe you want to show the
# distribution by party or chamber. Remember, we’re using this process to
# explore the data; try and make a plot that helps you understand it better.
# Then, do the same for your outcome variable, nominate_percentile. Print both
# plots here.



```


### 1C) Bivariate Correlations

### 1D) Plotting Bivariate relationships




## Question 2: Run a single regression


### 2A) Using lm()

### 2B) Interpreting results

### 2C) Regression and the Rubin Causal Model





## Question 3: Generalize to many regressions
